                ARONE hosts and manages practically all the eCRFs and IWRS it develops for its customers. Although this is by no means mandatory,
                our customers often opt for this possibility as it means they no longer have the headaches of maintaining
                server hardware and availability.

                Backing up our servers and our hosted data is an absolute priority. Each server is backed up regularly by different methods

                Our DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) covers all possible risks and means that operations are resumed with very little down time

                ARONE also hosts customer applications that require special management. For instance, as a direct result of the wealth of
                its experience with the pharmaceutical industry, ARONE has set up a quality system that guarantees data security
                in compliance with regulatory obligations and logs all events in the hosted application's lifecycle.

                ARONE provides user training in the applications it develops and installs, and particularly its eCRFs and IWRS solutions.
                We can take part in investigator meetings, train project staff who can then roll out the training in the
                different centers, or we can ourselves provide direct training in investigating centers. We can also take

                ARONE believes in validation, and devotes a great deal of effort to validating each and every project and study. This validation
                means that the development cycle is fully controlled from initial software design to it entering production.
                Likewise for each study, the aim is to exert end-to-end control right through from the initial requirements
                (which include the CRF, validation controls, management rules, etc.) to project production and follow-up
                (system maintenance). This validation, in addition to a number of tests, also includes customer involvement
                at several steps to ensure that the system's design perfectly matches your requirements.
